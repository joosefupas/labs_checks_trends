# Lab Analysis Trends and Risk Calculation

This project is designed to analyze lab test trends and calculate associated risks using various R packages. The focus is on plotting trend data for lab results and visually assessing risk levels based on predefined thresholds.

## Requirements

- **R**: A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- **ggplot2**: A data visualization package for R, part of the tidyverse, which makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages designed for data science, including tools for data manipulation, visualization, and more.
- **CVrisk**: An R package for calculating cardiovascular risk scores based on different models.

## Installation

To install the required R packages, use the following commands:

1. ggplot2: For creating complex, multi-layered graphics.
2. tidyverse: A collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization.
3. CVrisk: For calculating cardiovascular risk scores.

## Data

The data is read directly from a GitHub repository. It contains lab test results in a tab-separated values (TSV) format. Ensure that the data file is accessible at the specified URL.

## Usage

### Load and Prepare Data

The data is read and prepared for analysis. The `Date` column is converted to Date format for proper time series analysis.

### Trend Plot of Lab Analysis

A trend plot is created to visualize the lab test results over time. Points above the threshold are highlighted differently from those below the threshold to easily identify outliers.

### Plot Customization

The plot includes several customization features:
- Different line types for each lab item.
- Highlighting points above the threshold.
- Adding horizontal lines at threshold levels.
- Customizing axis labels, titles, and legends for better readability.
